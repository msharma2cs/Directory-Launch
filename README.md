# Directory-Launch

## Technologies: Python, Flask.

A simple web application that prompts the user for a directory path, then gathers a list of all directories in the path and displays as a list. Every item in the list has a launch button that performs a specified action on that library.

This is just a boiler-plate template code to keep the project structure and for demo(POC) purpose, and launch button just deletes the directory. It handles the basic case for invalid directories or incorrect(non existent) paths.

## Enhancements 
1. Functionality was added to display the status of the action.
2. Additional functionalities was added to copy, move, and open the selected directories to display list of files it contained.
3. Additional checks were implemented to handle directory permissions use cases.
